# Training beginners on Drupal

> Assuming a new member is coming on the team and you need to educate her/him so she/he can use Drupal.
> Before starting it is a good idea to check the **official, community supported, [Drupal.org User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/project/user_guide)**. 
> It is mirrored by drupalize.me and is availalbe as a **PDF** too. It is well organised and gets updated, something which is not true for online-videos.

## Training schedule

These are the proposed steps for (Drupal only) onboarding with approximately time needed.

- Study on **Drupalize.me** or similar online guide: 2 week
- Watch internal howto videos (how to work with the other members, company tools etc): 3 days
- Study internal documentation: 2 days
- Install all the development tools needed: 2 days
- Install Drupal locally, play with modules and functionality: 2 days
- Get known to your internal **Mentor** (a senior that has the responsibility for you): 1 day

After the initial training period (**4 week**) you can start as an **assistant developer** on a simple project with easy tasks.
