# Project Management

## Project Estimation Techniques

- **More than 1 person to do the estimation independently**. Then compare the estimations. Large offsets on the estimations need more internal discussion.
- Split functionalities into subtasks that make sense (eg a search, a display page etc)
- What "question" is the estimation trying to answer?
- Provide lots of details to an estimation.
- Do not give only numbers to customers (eg the price and the deadline).
- Try to not be strict about delivery dates and set the variables that may affect delivery.
- Keep useful statistics that can be reused on future estimations.
- Determine which parameter is flexible on the Project (time, budget or scope)

## Project Estimation Tips

- There is no such thing like an "accurate" estimate.
- Do not make promises, provide information.
- More than 1 person to make the estimation.
- If the budget is strictly fixed to not provide an over-budget estimation.

## Determining capacity (human resources)

- Who is available?
- What type of work can each person do?
- Try to have **people 100% on a single project**. Else there is a minimun of 15% reduced productivity for each person (known as "context-switch penalty").
- Try to have some alternates for the Project.

## How many people on a Project?

- Determine skills of each person.
- Know your team and their pace.
- Determine **which parameter is flexible** on the Project if any (**time, budget or scope**).
- A "good" developer is not a "great" developer. Plan for the **"average" skills person**.
- Varying degrees of effectiveness.
- Do not pretend estimates are accurate because they are not.
- Watch out for burnout.

## Large Project teams - Work Streams

- Ideal Team size of **3-4 people**.
- In large Teams create smaller Teams that can work independenly
- Create a **matrix with Tasks (work streams)** and assign to the Teams.
- Communication (meetings, calls, investigation etc) requires effort too and must be taken into account.
- Goals per Team must be clean.
- With independent smaller Teams it is easier to make quick and nimble progress.

---

## Project kickoff

- Ensure all the right people are present (including the vendor **decision makers**).
- Introduce the Team and the vendor decision makers.
- Describe how Communication, Tracking and Reporting will be done.
- Set rough excpectations.
- Make imeddiately **tactical decisions** (eg find out how an internal process works vendor side).
- Cast vision: Why this project?

## Project Brief

- The Task
- The Deliverables
- Background information
- The Objectives
- The target Audience
- Choice of Channels
- The key message
- The Budget
- Measurement
- Any Mandatories
- Possible Ideas
- Tone of voice

## Making accurate estimates in software development
- Break down the work into smaller tasks
- Donâ€™t assume without asking questions
- Propose adjusting the requirement
- Factor in your degree of confidence
- Agree on a sequence for estimating
- Set a maximum time limit for each task
- Do not forget about the extra things
