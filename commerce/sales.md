## How to get paid more by clients

- Make life of the customers easier (tasks flow, save time etc)
- Offer some tasks or material for free (freebies)
- Use convincing wording (exaplain why you are worthing the money they pay):
  - replace "maybe" with "guaranteed" or "risk-free" phrase
  - replace "we will try" to "we will definitely"
  - focus on **benefits** over **features** (what is the client gaining from your work)
  - explain how the life of the customer will become easier
  - explain how you will help the customer increase sales or results
  - explain why cheaper solutions (alternatives) do not fit to the client vision
