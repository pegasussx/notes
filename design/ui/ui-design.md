# UI design

## 10 Questions to answer when designing UIs for a CMS like Drupal

The questions refer to each element/component designed. In general, the UI design should answer to 4 questions:

- What (data, language etc)
- Where (position, part of another component etc)
- Who (permissions)
- How (skinning, display modes etc)

I really like designs that **contain these information** within the components through signs or plain text.

1. Multilingual
2. Reusable
3. Data source
4. Static vs Dynamic
5. Alternative displays
6. MVP vs Final component
7. Access permissions (CRUD)
8. Styling/skinning options
9. Ability to rearrange on the layout
10. Part of a bigger component
